What's Git?
  Git is like a memory book, it keeps track of your code and keeps different versions of it, think of it like restore points on your computer or iCloud backups, you're given multiple different previous verions to your code
  
What is Github?
  Similar to a library or something like your google drive, github is a way for you to store your code, share it amongst others and never lose it (unless you delete it)
  Github is a great way for you to keep track of your progress, share your code and collatborate with peers or help others online!

What is WebStorm?
  Webstorm is a tool, similar to google extensions! You can use WebStorm to help you write your code, it displays your mistakes and helps you optimize your time and coding instead of figuring it all out on your own digging through piece by piece.  It has a built in relationship with Git and Github so it's very useful if you're using either of the two.  

  For you to get Git you need to download the latest version of their website (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Go to the website link
2. Choose what operating system you're on
3. Click the link to download the latest version

For you to get webstorm you download it on the web as well, it's from jetbrains (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=windows)
1. Go to the website link and choose your operating system for the download
2. After downloading webstorm you want to link your git to webstorm do the shortcut(CTRL + ALT + S)
3. This should open up the settings, and from there you want to go to Version Control and select Git
4. Click the test button beside it, it should say 2.8.1 (the most updated version CAN CHANGE)

Make a repository! 
1. You want to create a new project in Webstorm and you want to go to File > New > HTML.
2. Afterwards you want to name the file whatever you'd like and we should now save it to our Git or upload it to github
3. Commit is like a memory of your code, this is important to know when using git.  Open the terminal in Webstorm on the bottom left panel
4. Type in "git init" then "git add ." then "git commit -m (Whatever you'd like)"
